## How to Make a Shell Shock Ruler
 
There are different ways to make a shell shock ruler, but one of the simplest and most effective methods is using a transparent plastic sheet and a marker. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Find a transparent plastic sheet that is large enough to cover your monitor screen. You can use an old binder cover, a document protector, or any other thin and clear material.
2. Place the plastic sheet over your screen and secure it with some tape. Make sure it is flat and smooth.
3. Launch Shell Shock Live and start a practice match with no wind and no opponents. Choose a weapon that has a straight trajectory, such as Sniper or Stream.
4. Aim your tank at 45 degrees and fire your weapon. You should see a red line showing the path of your projectile.
5. Using a marker, trace the red line on the plastic sheet. This will be your reference line for 45 degrees.
6. Repeat the same process for other angles, such as 30, 60, 75, and 90 degrees. You can use different colors for each angle if you want.
7. Label each line with its corresponding angle using a marker or a sticker.
8. Your shell shock ruler is ready! You can remove it from your screen and store it somewhere safe when you are not using it.

- Adjust your power according to the distance of your target. The longer the distance, the higher the power you need. You can use trial and error or memorize some common power values for each angle.
- Take into account the wind direction and speed. The wind will affect your projectile's trajectory depending on its angle and power. Generally, the higher the angle, the more wind influence. You can use some simple rules of thumb to correct your aim for wind:
    - If the wind is blowing towards your target, aim lower than usual.
    - If the wind is blowing away from your target, aim higher than usual.
    - If the wind is blowing sideways, aim slightly towards or away from the wind depending on its speed.
- Use different weapons for different situations. Some weapons have different trajectories, such as curved, arced, or bouncing. You can use your shell shock ruler as a guide, but you also need to consider how each weapon behaves differently.
- Practice makes perfect. The more you use your shell shock ruler, the more familiar you will become with its lines and angles. You will also develop a better sense of how to adjust your aim for different maps, winds, and weapons.
