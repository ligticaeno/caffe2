The album showcases Malmsteen's signature neoclassical metal style, blending heavy metal riffs with classical influences and virtuosic guitar solos. The album also contains some hard rock and ballad songs, such as "Heaven Tonight", "Dreaming (Tell Me)", and "Crystal Ball". The album's opening track, "Rising Force", is an instrumental that features Malmsteen's trademark arpeggios and sweeping techniques. The album's closing track, "Memories", is a short acoustic piece that serves as a tribute to Malmsteen's late mother.
 
Odyssey received mixed reviews from critics, who praised Turner's vocals and Malmsteen's guitar work, but criticized the album's production and lack of originality. Some critics also noted that Malmsteen sounded restrained and passionless on some tracks, possibly due to his recovery from a near-fatal car accident in 1987. Despite the mixed reception, Odyssey remains Malmsteen's highest-charting release on the Billboard 200 and one of his most popular albums among fans.

One of the positive reviews came from Louder Sound, who named Odyssey as their album of the week club review. They wrote: \"Odyssey is his fourth album and last purely great album. Itâs a pity that the Malmsteen/Turner line up couldnât last. Odyssey is by far the most accessible album that Malmsteen did. The songwriting is very melodic and the guitar playing is somewhat reigned in.\"[^1^] They also praised the album's diversity and balance, saying that it had \"something for everyone\".
 
However, not all critics were impressed by Odyssey. AllMusic gave the album two stars out of five, calling it \"a more subdued, polished collection seemingly designed for mainstream radio airplay\", but that it \"shows little difference in approach from [Malmsteen's] previous output\". They also remarked that the album lacked \"the fire and hunger\" of Malmsteen's earlier albums, and that some of the songs were \"formulaic\" and \"forgettable\".
 
Overall, Odyssey is a controversial album in Malmsteen's discography, as it divided fans and critics alike. Some consider it as his best work, while others see it as a sell-out or a decline. Nevertheless, Odyssey remains a significant milestone in Malmsteen's career, as it demonstrated his versatility and popularity as a guitarist and songwriter.
